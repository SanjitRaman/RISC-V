# Joint Statement on Challenges Faced

## Single Cycle

- Deciding the top level schematic, control paths for each instruction type.
    - adding additional mux's from lab4

- Load Decoder and WE Decoder added
    - to support load and store instructions

- Flags added to ALU
    - to support more branch instructions

- Deciding on testing methodology -- google tests
    - link to google test + verilator example
    - single instruction tests
    - mention UVM and why we didn't use it

- Debugging top level schematic
    - know that module level tests pass
    - using gtkwave to debug the top level schematic to check connections and control signals.

- Makefile
    - was difficult.
